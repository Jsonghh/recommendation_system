# recommendation_system
#### Overview
an apps recommendation framework using machine learning that uses the apps' metadata, users’ entitlements data and usage metrics to identify applications that a user can be interested in based on their own or department’s current apps usage or popularity of other apps.

#### Details:
• Developed an apps recommendation engine for around 4000 users based on machine learning that used the
metadata of about 300 apps, users’ entitlements data and usage metrics (Python, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn) <br>
• Defined the recommendation algorithm by implementing and evaluating machine learning models such as
Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering and K-Means using Python (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn)
